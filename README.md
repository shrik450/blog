# My Blog

This is my blog. All of the blog entries are markdown or org-mode files in
directories by year. 

This used to be a jekyll-generated SSG, but I decided that that wasn't worth the
effort of maintaining and working with, and GitHub's rendering of markdown and
org files is really good without any fussing.
